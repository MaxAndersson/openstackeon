=============
BOINC library
=============

When BOINC is applied to handle communication a series of addition dependencies must be fulfilled. On an Ubuntu 10 installation all these dependencies can be obtained via the package manager. As the client code is compiled against a *BOINC library*, this library must be created first (`CompileApp <http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/CompileApp>`_).

Dependencies
------------

* ``libarchive-dev``
* ``libssl-dev``
* ``libcurl4-gnutls-dev``

Installation
------------

The BOINC library can be built with the following commands::

    ./configure --disable-server --disable-client LDFLAGS=-static-libgcc
    make
    sudo make install

Where the install option makes the libraries and header files accessible system-wide.
